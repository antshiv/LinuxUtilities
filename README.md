# Linux Utilities

![Linux Terminal](@assets/linuxterminal.png)

This directory contains a collection of utility scripts designed to enhance my workflow on Linux, particularly with AwesomeWM and various AI CLI tools. The primary objective is to streamline daily tasks, automate repetitive actions, and facilitate a more efficient and seamless integration of these technologies.

## Scripts:

- `import_screenshots.sh`: A utility to manage screenshots and phone photos, moving them to designated directories and generating prompts for AI CLI tools.
- `rc.lua`: (AwesomeWM configuration file) - This file likely contains custom configurations for the Awesome Window Manager, tailoring its behavior and appearance to my specific needs.
- `redshift.sh`: A script likely related to Redshift, a program that adjusts the color temperature of the screen according to your surroundings, reducing eye strain.
- `remove_duplicate_assets.sh`: A script to identify and remove duplicate files, helping to keep the system clean and organized.
- `rescue-windows.sh`: A script potentially used for recovery or specific interactions with a Windows environment, possibly in a dual-boot or virtualized setup.
